    Information about a card in the game.

        defense: The defense value of the card.
        directions: The directions this card "overpowers". 
            When attacking: the card ignores the defense of the cards in these directions. If the card being attacked doesn't have a defense in the opposite direction, the attack is automatically successful. Otherwise, the outcome depends on a coin toss.
            When defending: the card ignores the attack of the cards in these directions. If the card being attacked doesn't have an attack in the opposite direction, the attack is automatically failed. Otherwise, the outcome depends on a coin toss.
